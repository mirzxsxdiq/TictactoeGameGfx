# **SIMPLE GRAPHICS TICTACTOE GAME**

This game was created using C Progamming Language during my free time in university to improve my programming skills.  
  
This game was intended as a practice project for me to improve myself outside of my class. The game uses a gfx library that was given by my lecturer. The game was also made in Linux.  
  
## **Installation**
  
The program uses a gfx library that runs on Linux machines using the X11 Window System. It may work on Mac, but not on windows.

To compile the program use the following command:

`gcc tictactoe.c gfx.c -o tictactoe.o -lX11 -lm`

To run the program use the following command:

`./tictactoe.o`

## **Credits**  
I made this project so I could practice my programming skills more it would have not been possible without my lecturer library and I am thankful for that. As this is my first solo project I would also like to give special thanks to myself for being able to complete this project.
